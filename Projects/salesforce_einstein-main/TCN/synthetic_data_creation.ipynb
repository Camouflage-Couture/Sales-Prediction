        "The dataset represents daily sales data of a product for a hypothetical company from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2023. Each row corresponds to a single day's data, including sales figures and several features that could influence sales. The dataset is designed to simulate real-world scenarios where various factors affect daily sales.\n",

        "**Sales**: The number of sales for the given day, generated using a Poisson distribution with some added noise to simulate daily sales variability.\n",

        "**Promotions**: A binary feature indicating whether there was a promotion on that day (1 for promotion, 0 otherwise). This is simulated using a binomial distribution with a probability of 0.2.\n",

        "**Holidays**: A binary feature indicating whether the day was a holiday (1 for holiday, 0 otherwise). This is simulated using a binomial distribution with a probability of 0.05.\n",

        "Here the **Consumer Confidence Index** is used as an Economic Indicator. CCI is a measure of how optimistic or pessimistic consumers are about the economy's current and future state. It's based on surveys that ask consumers about their perceptions of current economic conditions and their expectations for the future.\n",

        "Indication: Consumers feel positive about the economy and their financial situation.\n",
        "Impact on Sales: High confidence usually leads to increased consumer spending as people are more likely to make purchases, take out loans, and invest in high-value items.\n",

        "\n",
        "Indication: Consumers are worried about the economy and their financial future.\n",
        "Impact on Sales: Low confidence often results in decreased consumer spending as people tend to save more and avoid big purchases."
